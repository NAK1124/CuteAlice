                <li>Gangliogliomas, also known as Gangliocytomas and ganglioneuromas, are tumours that begin from groups of nerve cells (ganglion and glial cells) and grow in the brain. </li>

            <h3>Brief Explanation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gangliogliomas are rare tumours that often occur in children and young adults. 
                    They contain properties of both glial cells, 
                    which are responsible for providing the structural support of the central nervous system (CNS), 
                    and neuronal cells, which are the components of the CNS. This condition can occur in any part of the brain or spinal cord, 
                    but in rare cases,  ganglioglioma may transform into a higher-grade tumour. 
                    Children with certain genetic syndromes, 
                    including neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis, 
                    are at higher risk of developing glial tumours such as gangliogliomas.

            <h3>Specific Information About Epilepsy & Seizures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Epilepsy is a brain disorder highlighted by repeated seizures. A seizure is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behaviour due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain. Normally, the brain constantly generates tiny electrical impulses in an organized pattern as these impulses travel along the neurons - the network of nerve cells in the brain. Therefore, the disturbance of normal nerve cell activity may cause a loss of awareness. Some people recover immediately after a seizure, while others may take minutes to hours to be fully conscious. Epilepsy can also develop as the brain attempts to repair itself after a head injury, stroke, or other problems and eventually leads to creating nerve connection issues, resulting in seizures. 
                    During a seizure, many neurons send signals at the same time, much faster than normal. This surge of excessive electrical activity may cause involuntary movements, sensations, emotions, and/or behaviours. The disturbance of normal nerve cell activity may cause a loss of awareness. Some people recover immediately after a seizure, while others may take minutes to hours to feel like themselves again. During this time, they may feel tired, sleepy, and weak.

            <h3> Who Ms. Sarah is</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ms. Sarah is one of the english teachers at Urban International High School who is currently teaching grade 11 and 12 english. 
                    She is diagnosised with this brain disease also known as Ganglioglioma, which is a rare brain tumor.

            <h3>Interview with Ms. Sarah</h3>
            <img alt="Ganglioglioma" src="AAA/interview.webp" width="300" height="200"> 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ms. Sarah: I've had seizures since I was 6 years old. Usually, I have "absent" seizures where I feel an "aura" (distorted vision, slight head pressure) about 30 seconds before the seizure. The seizure lasts from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, during which I stiffen up, mumble, and sometimes ring my fingers or make fists. Occasionally, I have grand-mal seizures where I fall, shake, foam at the mouth, and my eyes roll back. These are rare.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem-solving abilities, since your diagnosis? How do these changes impact your daily activities and interactions?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ms. Sarah: Yes, I have memory loss and aphasia. I often lose my words or stop mid-sentence. Sometimes, I can't read or speak temporarily, but never both at the same time. As a teacher, this affects my work, but I've learned to adapt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interviewer: How has your diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy and ganglioglioma affected your daily life and routines? Can you provide specific examples of challenges you've faced?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ms. Sarah: I have to be more careful. I avoid contact sports and don't swim alone. I can't drive because you need to be seizure-free for a year to get a license, so I've never driven a car.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interviewer: What coping strategies or support systems have you found most helpful in managing your epilepsy and ganglioglioma? Are there particular therapies, lifestyle changes, or support groups that have made a significant difference?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ms. Sarah: One-on-one therapy has been helpful. 
                    I haven't tried support groups but I imagine they are useful. 
                    It's important to have people around who believe you can live a normal life. 
                    Some people are ignorant about epilepsy and neurological illnesses, 
                    so there's sometimes discrimination. 
                    Despite the challenges, people with these conditions can still live normal lives and have regular jobs. 
                    Having supportive people around is crucial for confidence and security.
